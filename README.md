The code of this repository can be used to implement a LeNet-like neural network for analyzing hand written digits; the initial architecture is improved using Bayesian optimization and ensembling and the performances of the various approaches are analyzed and compared. A brief but complete analysis can be found in the pdf file of the repository.
The dataset used for training and analyzing the models has been downloaded from Kaggle and it is composed by the two files: "train.csv" and "test.csv".
